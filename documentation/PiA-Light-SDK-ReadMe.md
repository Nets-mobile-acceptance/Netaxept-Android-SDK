# PiA-Light - Netaxept Android SDK v1.1.2-SNAPSHOT
----

PiA-Light Netaxept Android SDK is a light-weight version of the [Pia - Netaxept Android SDK](https://github.com/Nets-mobile-acceptance/Netaxept-Android-SDK). This version does not include the Card Scanner functionality (_CardIO_ Library is removed).

# Installation
----
+ Please add to the project's `gradle.properties` file the values for the following variables as provided by Nets

```gradle

## Required Maven URLs and Credentials ##
MAVEN_URL_PIA=provided value for URL to PiA SDK

```

+ Please add code below to the project's `build.gradle` file.

```gradle
 allprojects {
        repositories {
            google()
            jcenter()

           maven {
                url MAVEN_URL_PIA
                credentials {
                    username MAVEN_REPO_USERNAME
                    password MAVEN_REPO_PASSWORD
                }
            }
        }
    }

```

+ In your `build.gradle` application level file, add:

```gradle

implementation('eu.nets.pia:pia-light-sdk:1.1.2-SNAPSHOT') { transitive = true; }

```

# Usage
---
Please check our [GitHub page](https://github.com/Nets-mobile-acceptance/Netaxept-Android-SDK) for more details related to new versions, documentation and best-practice code samples.

**Xamarin Support**: The only difference between the Official version and this one is that you need to include the [Light-Version DLL File](Xamarin) in your application.
**ReactNative Support**: The only difference between the Official Version and this one is that in the `buid.gradle` file in your _Bridge_ you need to include the library from our Nexus private repository. Check **Installation** step for how to do it.

**Note:** Please have in mind that since _CardIO_ Library is removed from this version, all **UI Customization APIs** related to CardIO are no longer used.

# Permissions
----
These permissions are handled inside the binary, and your integration won't require any additional changes.

**PiA SDK** will require the internet permissions to be fully operational.

```xml

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

```

**CardIo** is no longer available, so _Camera Permission_ is no longer required.

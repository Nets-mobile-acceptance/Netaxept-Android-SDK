# Frequently Asked Questions
---
If you encounter any blockers when integrating the `Netaxept - Android SDK`, feel free to check the [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQs.md) page. If any of these answers does not fit your question, don't hesitate to [contact us](#contact).


# Requirements
----
**Minimum supported Android version is 5.0** - Due to PCI DSS requirements and known vulnerabilities in secure protocols less than TLS 1.2, TLS 1.2 is the only secure protocol available when connecting towards Netaxept. For this reason, we don't support the Android versions lower than 5.0 which are NOT enabled/supported TLS 1.2 by default. For more information, you can check the details from Netaxept.


# Permissions
----
These permissions are handled inside the binary, and your integration won't require any additional changes.

**PiA SDK** will require the internet permissions to be fully operational.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

**CardIo** library integrated by PiA SDK will also require permission for Camera and Vibrate.

```xml
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
```
